## Res publica litterarum connexa

This project aims to look at the "Neo-Latin world" with a Linked-Open-Data approach.

So far, the *Index nominum* of Jozef IJsewijn foundational *Companion to Neo-Latin Studies* (Part I, 2nd edition, Leuven 1990) has been scanned, OCRed, and to some extend reconciled with either VIAF or Wikidata.

Other *Indices* from similar works will be added in the future.
